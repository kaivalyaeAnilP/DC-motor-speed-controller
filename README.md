# DC-motor-speed-controller
A DC motor is interfaced with an 8051 microcontroller that outputs a pulse width modulated(PWM) waveform to control its speed of rotation. It has four speeds of operation, starting from approx. 0 rpm and goes to approx. 75 rpm. A switch is connected to I/O port 1.0 of the 8051 microcontroller that changes the speed of the motor when pressed and released. The PWM waveform is supplied from port 2.0 of the 8051 microcontroller. When the motor is off, port 2.0 supplies an output of 0V and the motor does not rotate.  If the switch is pressed and released, port 2.0 supplies a PWM waveform having duty cycle of one-third, causing the dc motor to rotate at approx.  rpm. If the process is repeated, the port starts supplying a PWM waveform of duty cycle 0.5, causing the motor's speed to increase to approx.  rpm. If it is again pressed and released, the port supplies a PWM waveform of duty cycle two-thirds, and the motor speed increases to approx.  rpm. Pressing and releasing the switch again will cause port 2.0's O/P to go back to 0V, turning off the motor.
